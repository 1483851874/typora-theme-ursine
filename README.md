# Ursine

A Typora theme inspired by Bear

![thumbnail](thumbnail.png)

Uses *Avenir Next LT Pro* and *Adelle* fonts, & the colors are based on Bear's *Red Graphite* and *Dark Graphite* themes.

Code fence themes adapted from CodeMirror's *3024 Day* and *Dracula* themes for Ursine Polar and Umbra, respectively.

> Note: These themes have been designed and tested on **MacOS**. They have not been fully tested, but they should theoretically work fine for Windows and Linux. However, these themes do *not* include styling for the Windows *"unibody"* style.

## Installation
